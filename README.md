## Neurals Networks and Its Application in Computer Vision
This course is aimed to respond to the question: **What are the key steps in designing a deep learning pipeline**

**NOTE**: Most of the materials in the notebooks are discussed in the class, rather than the notebook itself, and these notebooks are supplementary materials for the class.

###[1. INTRO]
We start with a very general discussion of the nature of tasks that machine learning can tackle, more specificially Classification problems.
- Binary Classification
- Multilabel Classification

###[2. BROADCASTING (NUMPY)]
We review machine learning project's pipeline in detail and get an understanding of two fundamental operations in neural networks.
- Review
- Gradient Descent
- Broadcasting

###[3. HAND WRITTEN DIGIT RECOGNITION (TORCH)]
One application of Neural Networks in the area of computer vision is handwritten digit recognition. We go over the process of designing a pipeline for that purpose.
- Preprocessing
* and experiment with two different neural networks
- Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

###[4. CNN]
As we look at our project, we try to understand the different parts of the model that can improve its accuracy and also get an understanding of the components of CNNs.
- Review
- Initializing Weights 
- Regularizations
- CNNs
