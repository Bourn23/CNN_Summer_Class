## Neurals Networks and Its Application in Computer Vision
This course is aimed to respond to the question: **What are the key steps in designing a deep learning pipeline**

**NOTE**: Most of the materials in the notebooks are discussed in the class, rather than the notebook itself, and these notebooks are supplementary materials for the class.

### [1. INTRO](https://github.com/Bourn23/CNN_Summer_Class/blob/master/nbs/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb)
We start with a very general discussion of the nature of tasks that machine learning can tackle, more specificially Classification problems.
- Binary Classification
- Multilabel Classification

### [2. BROADCASTING (NUMPY)](https://github.com/Bourn23/CNN_Summer_Class/blob/master/nbs/2.%20Broadcasting.ipynb)
We review machine learning project's pipeline in detail and get an understanding of two fundamental operations in neural networks.
- Review
- Gradient Descent
- Broadcasting

### [3. HAND WRITTEN DIGIT RECOGNITION (TORCH)](https://github.com/Bourn23/CNN_Summer_Class/blob/master/nbs/3.%20HODA%20-%20Digit%20Recognition%20with%20PyTorch.ipynb)
One application of Neural Networks in the area of computer vision is handwritten digit recognition. We go over the process of designing a pipeline for that purpose.
- Preprocessing
* and experiment with two different neural networks
- Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

### [4. CNN](https://github.com/Bourn23/CNN_Summer_Class/blob/master/nbs/4.%20CNN.ipynb)
As we look at our project, we try to understand the different parts of the model that can improve its accuracy and also get an understanding of the components of CNNs.
- Review
- Initializing Weights 
- Regularizations
- CNNs
